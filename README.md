##RPSBR
The game spawns three teams of rocks, papers and scissors. Currently, each starts with a random initial speed and does not change it. When two objects collide, the one that "loses" based on the rules of rock-paper-scissors is turned into an instance of the one that "won".

TODO:
* Add collisions between objects based on conservation of momentum and energy.
* Give objects the ability to somehow alter their speed (with limitations).
* Try various machine learning algorithms (evolutionary, etc), so game objects can come up with strategies to win. Note: see if they can be taught to account for a random initial speed and move accordingly.
